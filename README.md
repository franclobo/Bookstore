# Bookstore
The Bookstore is a website wich contains all your favorite books, categorized by title and author and also a graphic representation of your progress.

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux.
- Gitflow.

## Getting Started

The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website. I created an MVP version of it that allows to:

- Display a list of books.
- Add a book.
- Remove a selected book.
- By building this application, you will learn how to use React and Redux.
